## 💡 Tips for Success

### ✅ Best Practices

1. **Use visible browser** - More reliable, less likely to be blocked
2. **Scrape during off-peak hours** - Less traffic, fewer CAPTCHAs
3. **Start small** - Test with 5 profiles first
4. **Use a test account** - Don't risk your primary LinkedIn account
5. **Add delays** - Don't rush, let pages load fully

### Browser Mode Options

The app offers two modes:

- **Visible Browser (Recommended)** 
  - ✅ Watch the scraping process
  - ✅ Solve CAPTCHAs manually
  - ✅ Less likely to be detected
  - ✅ Better for debugging

- **Headless Mode**
  - ⚠️ Runs in background
  - ⚠️ More likely to trigger security
  - ⚠️ Can't solve CAPTCHAs manually
